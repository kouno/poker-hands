Poker Hands
===========

A poker deck contains 52 cards - each card has a suit which is one of clubs,
diamonds, hearts, or spades (denoted C, D, H, and S in the input data). Each
card also has a value which is one of 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, jack, queen,
king, ace (denoted ). For scoring purposes, the suits are unordered while the
values are ordered as given above, with 2 being the lowest and ace the highest
value.

You may find it helpful to denote the values with 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, T, J,
Q, K, A and the suits with C, D, H, and S, i.e. 2C is the two of clubs and QS
is the queen of spades.
